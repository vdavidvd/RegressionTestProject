Hi there!

This is SeleniumWebDriver Hybrid Project in Java. This project is testing the https://www.saucedemo.com/ application and its
functionalities.

I selected couple of functionalities:
- Login Page
- Inventory Page
- End to End

To start this project you need to have Java version 11 or higher, Maven installed in your machine and some Java Editior if you want to start there or 
if you want to start this project in command prompt then you need to position yourself in the project directory where pom.xml is presented and open 
there command promp and run command mvn test. After that project will start and when all tests are finished you will get Extent Report in HTML located in 
ExtentReports folder under project directory.
